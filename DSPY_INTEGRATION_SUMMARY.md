## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **DSPy Modules Implemented**

1. **TutorRAG Module**
   ```python
   class TutorRAG(dspy.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           self.retrieve = dspy.retrievers.Embeddings(...)
           self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought(
               "context, question, difficulty_level -> response, explanation, next_steps"
           )
   ```

2. **MathTutor Module**
   ```python
   class MathTutor(dspy.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           self.solve_step_by_step = dspy.ProgramOfThought(
               "problem, problem_type -> solution_steps, verification_code, final_answer"
           )
   ```

### **Integration Points**
